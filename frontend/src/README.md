## **Project Overview**

**LandGuard AI** is a hackathon project designed to help users **monitor and manage land and environmental data** efficiently. Using AI insights and interactive geospatial tools, the app enables stakeholders to visualize land areas, analyze environmental metrics, and engage with projects via a marketplace.

---

## **Problem Statement**

* Environmental and land management data is often **fragmented or inaccessible**.
* Lack of tools to visualize geospatial information in an interactive and insightful way.
* Difficult for stakeholders to **connect, fund, or participate** in conservation or development projects.

---

## **Solution**

LandGuard AI solves these challenges by:

* Providing **interactive maps** for land visualization.
* Offering **AI-generated insights** for monitoring and predictions.
* Facilitating a **marketplace for environmental projects**.
* Delivering a **modern and responsive user interface** for easy navigation.

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Lucide React Icons
* **Routing & State:** React Router DOM
* **Maps:** Leaflet, React-Leaflet
* **Linting & Styling:** ESLint, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
* **Build & Dev Tools:** CRA (`react-scripts`)



## **Installation & Running the App**

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd landguard-hackathon/frontend
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Opens on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Hot-reload enabled for changes in `src/`.

### Step 4: Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

* Output folder: `frontend/build/`
* Can be hosted on any static server.

## **How the App Works**

1. **Home Page**: Provides an overview and app navigation.
2. **Interactive Map**: Visualizes land areas and AI insights using Leaflet.
3. **Marketplace**: Lists ongoing land/environmental projects and enables engagement.
4. **Navigation**: Smooth, responsive menu powered by TailwindCSS.

## **Monetization Strategy**

Potential ways to monetize LandGuard AI:

1. **Subscription Plans**

   * Offer advanced analytics, real-time alerts, or premium mapping layers for paid users.

2. **Marketplace Commission**

   * Take a small commission on funding transactions or environmental project collaborations.

3. **Data Analytics Services**

   * Sell aggregated, anonymized insights to government agencies, NGOs, or private organizations.

4. **Sponsorship & Ads**

   * Partner with environmental organizations for sponsored content or promoted projects.

---

## **Future Features**

* **User Authentication** with profiles and contribution tracking.
* **AI Predictions** for land risk, deforestation, or conservation priority.
* **Data Export & Reporting** for environmental monitoring.
* **Real-time Collaboration** in the marketplace.
* **Mobile App Support** for field use.
